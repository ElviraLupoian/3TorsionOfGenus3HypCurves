# 3TorsionOfGenus3HypCurves

This is the MAGMA code used to compute the 3-torsion subgroups of the modular Jacobians J0(30) and J0(40), as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02225v2.

In the process of rewriting this paper, the author has found a more efficient way of implementing the computation of the minimal polynomials of the points described in the paper. The code for this will be uploaded soon.
